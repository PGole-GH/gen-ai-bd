Here is an example of my dataset:
"id";"first_name";"last_name";"age";"country"
1;Darcy;Phillips;24;YE
Here is a task:
Write functions using Spark SQL API to:
•	Calculate how many accounts of each type there are using Spark SQL. The return type is a dataframe [account_type: string, account_type_count: int] 
•	Calculate only the balance and the latest date for each account from transactions.csv. To calculate the balance, summarize all the transactions for each account. The return type is a dataframe [account_id: string, balance: string, latest_date: date].

Before we start coding the Spark SQL functions, let's address the tasks you provided:

You mention "Calculate how many accounts of each type there are using Spark SQL", but there is no 'account_type' or any related field in the example dataset you provided.
You want to calculate the balance and the latest date for each account from transactions.csv. However, you haven't provided a sample of the transactions.csv dataset.
Assuming there are the necessary fields in the actual dataset, here's how you can implement the tasks:

For calculating how many accounts of each type:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import count

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("sparkSQLExample").getOrCreate()

# Loading data
data = spark.read.csv('path_to_your_file.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=";")

# Assuming your data has a column called 'account_type'
account_counts = data.groupBy("account_type").agg(count("id").alias("account_type_count"))

account_counts.show()
For calculating the balance and the latest date for each account from transactions.csv:
Assuming transactions.csv has fields account_id, transaction_amount, and transaction_date:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, max

# Loading transaction data
transactions = spark.read.csv('path_to_transactions.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=";")

# Grouping by account_id to calculate balance and latest date
balance_and_date = transactions.groupBy("account_id")\
    .agg(
        sum("transaction_amount").alias("balance"),
        max("transaction_date").alias("latest_date")
    )

balance_and_date.show()
Note: Ensure that transactions.csv is in the appropriate path and contains the relevant fields. If not, you need to adjust the script accordingly. Additionally, adjust the path for your main dataset file in the first script.

Please correct the code having in mind that there are 3 datasets:
1. accounts:
"id";"first_name";"last_name";"age";"country"
1;Darcy;Phillips;24;YE
2.  country_abbreviation:
country_full_name;abbreviation
Argentina;AR
3. transactions
"id";"amount";"account_type";"transaction_date";"country"

ChatGPT
Alright, given the structure of the three datasets you've provided, I'll give you the Spark SQL code for each of the tasks:

Loading all datasets:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("sparkSQLExample").getOrCreate()

# Loading accounts data
accounts = spark.read.csv('path_to_accounts_file.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=";")

# Loading country abbreviation data
country_abbrev = spark.read.csv('path_to_country_abbreviation_file.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=";")

# Loading transaction data
transactions = spark.read.csv('path_to_transactions_file.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True, sep=";")
Calculate how many accounts of each type there are:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import count

account_counts = transactions.groupBy("account_type").agg(count("id").alias("account_type_count"))
account_counts.show()
Calculate the balance and the latest date for each account:
python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, max

balance_and_date = transactions.groupBy("id")\
    .agg(
        sum("amount").alias("balance"),
        max("transaction_date").alias("latest_date")
    )

balance_and_date.show()
If you also want to join the transaction dataframe with the accounts and country abbreviation dataframes to enrich the information or replace abbreviations, here is how you can do it:

python
Copy code
# Assuming the account's "id" matches the transaction's "id" and "country" matches abbreviation:
joined_data = transactions.join(accounts, transactions.id == accounts.id, 'left')\
    .join(country_abbrev, transactions.country == country_abbrev.abbreviation, 'left')
Note: Adjust the paths path_to_accounts_file.csv, path_to_country_abbreviation_file.csv, and path_to_transactions_file.csv with the actual paths to your datasets.

cast balance to string 
ChatGPT
Alright, let's update the balance and date calculation function to cast the balance as a string:

Using Spark SQL functions:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, max, col, cast

# Calculate balance and latest date for each account
balance_and_date = transactions.groupBy("id")\
    .agg(
        sum("amount").alias("balance"),
        max("transaction_date").alias("latest_date")
    )

# Cast the balance to string
balance_and_date = balance_and_date.withColumn("balance", col("balance").cast("string"))

balance_and_date.show()
Here, we're simply adding an additional line of code using the withColumn function to modify the "balance" column by casting it to a string type.

format balance to 2 decimal places before
ChatGPT
To format the balance to two decimal places, you can use the round function. Let's modify the previous code to include that:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, max, col, round, format_number

# Calculate balance and latest date for each account
balance_and_date = transactions.groupBy("id")\
    .agg(
        round(sum("amount"), 2).alias("balance"),  # Round to 2 decimal places
        max("transaction_date").alias("latest_date")
    )

# Cast the rounded balance to string and format it
balance_and_date = balance_and_date.withColumn("balance", format_number(col("balance"), 2))

balance_and_date.show()
In this code, we're using the round function to round the sum to two decimal places. After that, we're using the format_number function to ensure that the number is formatted as a string with two decimal places, even if the number is a whole number (e.g., "10.00" instead of "10").
