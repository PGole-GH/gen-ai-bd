I have 3 datasets:
1. accounts:
"id";"first_name";"last_name";"age";"country"
1;Darcy;Phillips;24;YE
2.  country_abbreviation:
country_full_name;abbreviation

3. transactions
"id";"amount";"account_type";"transaction_date";"country"

Write a function using Spark Python to calculate total earnings (sum of transactions above 0) for each user from Switzerland by year as a pivot table. The result dataframe should contain user full names as one field split by whitespace, years, and earning values.

To achieve this, we will need to perform the following steps:

Filter transactions with an amount greater than 0 (i.e., earnings).
Join the transactions DataFrame with the accounts DataFrame based on the account id and country abbreviation.
Join the resulting DataFrame with the country_abbreviation DataFrame based on country abbreviation.
Filter out rows where the country is not 'Switzerland'.
Extract the year from the transaction_date.
Group by full name and year, and compute the sum of earnings for each group.
Pivot the DataFrame based on the year to produce the final result.
Here's how you can write this function using PySpark:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, concat_ws, col, year

def earnings_pivot_table(accounts, country_abbreviation, transactions):
    # Filter transactions with earnings
    earnings_df = transactions.filter(transactions.amount > 0)
    
    # Join transactions with accounts
    joined_df = earnings_df.join(accounts, earnings_df.id == accounts.id)
    
    # Join with country abbreviations and filter for Switzerland
    swiss_earnings_df = joined_df.join(country_abbreviation, joined_df.country == country_abbreviation.abbreviation).filter(country_abbreviation.country_full_name == 'Switzerland')
    
    # Extract year from transaction_date
    swiss_earnings_df = swiss_earnings_df.withColumn("year", year(swiss_earnings_df.transaction_date))
    
    # Group by full name and year
    grouped_df = swiss_earnings_df.groupBy(concat_ws(' ', swiss_earnings_df.first_name, swiss_earnings_df.last_name).alias("full_name"), "year").agg(sum("amount").alias("earnings"))
    
    # Pivot table
    pivot_df = grouped_df.groupBy("full_name").pivot("year").sum("earnings").fillna(0)

    return pivot_df

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("earningsPivot").getOrCreate()

# Assuming dataframes are read from CSVs or other sources into: accounts_df, country_abbreviation_df, transactions_df
result_df = earnings_pivot_table(accounts_df, country_abbreviation_df, transactions_df)

result_df.show()
A couple of things to note:

You will need to read your datasets into the respective DataFrames (accounts_df, country_abbreviation_df, and transactions_df) using appropriate Spark read operations before calling the function.
This solution assumes that the column names in your provided datasets are unique across the different DataFrames, if not you might have to adjust the column references in the joins and other operations.
The fillna(0) method is used to replace any null values in the pivot table with zeros. If there's no transaction for a user in a particular year, it will show as 0.
This solution is for Spark's DataFrame API, which is different from RDD API. Make sure you have the appropriate PySpark dependencies set up.

AnalysisException: [AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE] Reference `country` is ambiguous, could be: [`country`, `country`].
ChatGPT
The AnalysisException you're encountering is due to ambiguous column references. When we join DataFrames in Spark, columns with the same name in both DataFrames can cause ambiguity.

Let's fix the issue by using DataFrame aliasing:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, concat_ws, col, year

def earnings_pivot_table(accounts, country_abbreviation, transactions):
    # Filter transactions with earnings
    earnings_df = transactions.filter(transactions.amount > 0)
    
    # Alias the DataFrames
    acc_alias = accounts.alias("acc")
    country_alias = country_abbreviation.alias("country")
    trans_alias = earnings_df.alias("trans")
    
    # Join transactions with accounts
    joined_df = trans_alias.join(acc_alias, trans_alias.id == acc_alias.id)
    
    # Join with country abbreviations and filter for Switzerland
    swiss_earnings_df = joined_df.join(country_alias, joined_df.country == country_alias.abbreviation).filter(country_alias.country_full_name == 'Switzerland')
    
    # Extract year from transaction_date
    swiss_earnings_df = swiss_earnings_df.withColumn("year", year(swiss_earnings_df.transaction_date))
    
    # Group by full name and year
    grouped_df = swiss_earnings_df.groupBy(concat_ws(' ', swiss_earnings_df.first_name, swiss_earnings_df.last_name).alias("full_name"), "year").agg(sum("amount").alias("earnings"))
    
    # Pivot table
    pivot_df = grouped_df.groupBy("full_name").pivot("year").sum("earnings").fillna(0)

    return pivot_df

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("earningsPivot").getOrCreate()

# Assuming dataframes are read from CSVs or other sources into: accounts_df, country_abbreviation_df, transactions_df
result_df = earnings_pivot_table(accounts_df, country_abbreviation_df, transactions_df)

result_df.show()
I've added the alias() function to provide explicit aliases for the DataFrames, which should help remove the ambiguity. Now, when referring to columns, we can prefix them with the alias (e.g., acc_alias.id or trans_alias.id) to clarify which DataFrame the column belongs to.

3 / 3

I see the error is still indicating an ambiguous reference to the country column. This is due to the fact that the country column exists in both the accounts and transactions dataframes. Let's disambiguate the reference.

Here's the revised part of the code with more explicit column references:

python
Copy code
# ...
# Join transactions with accounts
joined_df = trans_alias.join(acc_alias, trans_alias.id == acc_alias.id, 'inner').select(trans_alias["*"], acc_alias["first_name"], acc_alias["last_name"])

# Join with country abbreviations and filter for Switzerland
swiss_earnings_df = joined_df.join(country_alias, joined_df.country == country_alias.abbreviation).filter(country_alias.country_full_name == 'Switzerland')
# ...
The key change here is to use the .select() method after the join operation to explicitly select the columns we're interested in. This way, we don't duplicate the country column from both dataframes.

Now, try to run the function again with this fix.
