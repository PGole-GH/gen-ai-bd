User
I have 3 datasets:
1. accounts:
"id";"first_name";"last_name";"age";"country"
1;Darcy;Phillips;24;YE
2.  country_abbreviation:
country_full_name;abbreviation
Argentina;AR
3. transactions
"id";"amount";"account_type";"transaction_date";"country"
179528;-730.86;Business;"2013-07-10";SV

Write a function using pyspark that expects a transactions dataset as input and returns it with an additional column "level". The value of "level " is calculated based on the "amount" column as:
•	Top 25% of all transactions get a value "high".
•	The next 50% of all transactions get "average".
•	The rest gets "low".

Sure, to compute the levels based on the amount column in the transactions dataset using PySpark, you can follow the steps:

Import necessary libraries.
Calculate quantiles for the amount column.
Define a function (or UDF in PySpark) to assign levels based on the amount.
Apply the function to the transactions DataFrame to create a new column.
Here's a PySpark code snippet that does this:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

# Create a spark session (assuming you don't have one already)
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Quantile example").getOrCreate()

# Assuming you've read your transactions data into a DataFrame called transactions_df

# Calculate quantiles
quantiles = transactions_df.approxQuantile("amount", [0.25, 0.75], 0.01)
low_quantile, high_quantile = quantiles

# Define the UDF to assign levels
def assign_level(amount):
    if amount > high_quantile:
        return "high"
    elif amount > low_quantile:
        return "average"
    else:
        return "low"

# Register UDF with spark
level_udf = F.udf(assign_level, StringType())

# Add "level" column
result_df = transactions_df.withColumn("level", level_udf(transactions_df["amount"]))

# Show the result
result_df.show()

# If you need to return the result, you can return the result_df
This code should give you a DataFrame with the additional "level" column as described.

please write it as a standard python function not udf

Alright! To achieve the desired outcome without using a UDF (User Defined Function), we can utilize PySpark's native window functions. Here's how:

Use Window functions to sort the amount column.
Utilize percent_rank() to get the relative rank of each transaction's amount.
Use the withColumn method to add the "level" column based on conditions determined by the percentile rank of the amount.
Here's the function:

python
Copy code
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

def add_transaction_level(transactions_df):
    # Create a window spec
    windowSpec = Window.orderBy(F.desc("amount"))

    # Calculate percent rank
    transactions_df = transactions_df.withColumn("percent_rank", F.percent_rank().over(windowSpec))

    # Define "level" based on the percentile rank
    transactions_df = transactions_df.withColumn(
        "level",
        F.when(transactions_df["percent_rank"] <= 0.25, "high")
        .when((transactions_df["percent_rank"] > 0.25) & (transactions_df["percent_rank"] <= 0.75), "average")
        .otherwise("low")
    )

    # Drop the temporary percent_rank column
    transactions_df = transactions_df.drop("percent_rank")

    return transactions_df

# Test the function
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Add Level Column").getOrCreate()

data = [
    (179528, -730.86, "Business", "2013-07-10", "SV"),
    (179529, -500.86, "Business", "2013-07-11", "SV"),
    (179530, -930.86, "Business", "2013-07-12", "SV"),
    (179531, -250.86, "Business", "2013-07-13", "SV")
]
columns = ["id", "amount", "account_type", "transaction_date", "country"]
transactions_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

result_df = add_transaction_level(transactions_df)
result_df.show()
By following the approach above, we avoid UDFs and use only PySpark's built-in functions, which can be more efficient on large datasets.
